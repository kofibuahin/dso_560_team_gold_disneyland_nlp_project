            "100.0% this be my first time go to a Disney and I never expect it to be that bad   firstly   hkd be way too overcrowded and they don t limit the amount of visitor there be a day   I believe that 200 people should be the maximum since I only go to a couple of ride   SPACE_MTN    fast track ticket      buzz_lightyear lightyear astro blaster   jungle river cruise   autopia   it s a small world   stitch encounter and slinky dog spin   for I   the stitch encounter and the slinky dog spin be the bad because the stitch encounter be basically watch stitch talk and have a chance of talk to he    on screen   for VISITOR    and I think it be a ride   the que be horribly long    1 hour on a hot day    the slinky dog ride be very bad either   45   minute que to go on a dog ride    3 4 lap of a a circle    which make the ride less than 1 hour   however   I do recommend autopia   SPACE_MTN   astro blastersand the jungle river cruise   on the other hand   the food there be disgusting and dry which cost 98 HongKong dollar    equivilent to    9 80 uk money    what a rip off          the staff have bad manner   the one I experience be the one in the jungle river cruise   somehow   they show disrespect to mainland china people since my VISITOR and I split the group in half because half of we want to rest and half of we want to go on ride   so they find a ride and they call we to go and when we reach there they didn t let we through since they think we be que cutting but my VISITOR be at the front of the que and they be talk disrespectfully to my VISITOR as his first language be mandarin but his cantonese be good   but   when my mum come and speak cantonese they go silent and let we through   here we can the see the discrimination between hongkongese and chinese mainlander   also   people from south west china have well manner than mainlander so I don t understand why they think we be mainlander   I m from the uk and find this a rasict   in conclusion   I find hkd terrible   I do not reccomend hkd to people because of the overcrowded visitor   the positive thing about this trip be that you get to watch the 9 00pm firework and get to learn your lesson   the park open at 8 00 or 9 00 and close at 10 00 but when my VISITOR arrive   there be a bunch of people already there   also   be careful since you be at risk of have your visitor lose   from a review of a teenager from the uk\n",
