Our objective is to derive high level meaning from the thousands of Disney Parks reviews and develop business recommendations that can prevent the churn of customers that had a negative experience. Investing in these recommendations will save Disney Parks millions of dollars over the next decade by preventing a higher global churn rate and bringing all customers back to the Happiest Place On Earth and increasing global attendance.

By analyzing the Disney Parks reviews with the sentiment analysis BERT model, logistic regression, and topic modeling, we were able to deliver 7 main recommendations, 2-3 per Disney Branch, that can make a huge impact in the future of Disney Parks. From impactful renovations, to meeting customer needs, Disney can invest in our recommendations to keep the customers coming back and save anywhere between $44,361,375.17 - $66,542,062.75  in annual revenue across its 3 parks in California, Paris and Hong Kong.
